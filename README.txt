This module will track IP changes on AWS RDS instances and update a given (NLB) target-group with theses IP addresses.


Most of the python code comes from [1], inspired by [2]

Schema of architecture:

---------------------------
| RDS Events subscription |
---------------------------
                |
                |       -------     ----------     --------------------
                +------>| SNS |---->| Lambda |---->| NLB target-group |
                        -------     ----------     --------------------

When invoked, the lambda function will:

 * Lookup IP addresses from given FQDN list
 * check target-group registered IPs (target health isn't taken into account)
 * add/remove IP from target group so they match the FQDN list.
